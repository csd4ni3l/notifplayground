Games made inside notifications! Currently includes Flappy Bird, Maze, Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris and a WPS test!

Some parts of Tetris are based on my other project, ShatterStack, which is a Block Blast style game.

The whole thing is just completely unusable on Windows due to Windows having such a high animation delay for notifications. Also, on Windows, only the WPS test works, due to Windows only allowing up to 141 characters in a notification. I only tested on Arch Linux with Hyprland + ML4W dotfiles, so your mileage may differ.
